<br/><p class="p noindent">the heat is beginning. North winds sweeping over the long <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">tract</span> of country in that direction become 
<br/>so heated when they come here they are like the blast of a furnace, sometimes crumble the grass into

<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p noindent">My Dear Parents &amp; Sisters</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In case I have no other opportunity of writing you 
<br/>previous to setting off towards the north I now begin. I am sorry I 
<br/>had not one ready yesterday when a Griqua passed this way 
<br/>I sent several to friends &amp; I hope this wont be long behind 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>any of which you may hear</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am busy learning the language which is not remarkably 
<br/>difficult the only impediment is a want of proper aids such 
<br/>as Dict<span class="sup ">s</span> Grammars &amp;c I hope however soon to conquer 
<br/>it &amp; then preach Christ &amp; him crucified to the <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: illegible">[      ]</span>Bechuanas
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I have a great deal of work in the way of helping the infirm 
<br/>&amp; many of them seem attached to me on account of little 
<br/>attentions shewn to themselves or children of whom they are 
<br/>remarkable fond. Mothers are mothers I see all over 
<br/>the world if only a little if only a little of poor humanity remains uncorrupted 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>by the customs of sin. How is my mother I Hope comfortable
<br/>May God bless her and give her an inheritance with the 
<br/>blessed in Heaven by sanctifying her to himself</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have got no letter as yet from you &amp; have now 
<br/>written you 5. It is no easy matter to have all the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>correspondence to oneself but I hope they are on their way 
<br/>Well what shall I tell you about, I suppose Janet &amp; 
<br/>Agnes would like a lion story or something of that 
<br/>sort that I cant however give for I have not dared to 
<br/>look one in the face. A terrible fellow was shot a short 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>distance from this &amp; the sight of his dead body so (shall I 
<br/>say) frightened me I have no wish to have intercourse 
<br/>with his majesty again. I would rather meet with 
<br/>some <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">members</span> of the Royal families among men than of beasts 
<br/>for the former in this country at least are an 
insignific-<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>ant race of beings, distinguished for nothing but 
<br/>superior impudence in begging &amp; generally worse looking 
<br/>than any of their attendants. I have been in 
<br/>company with <span class="">Waterboer</span> the Griqua chief. He is 
<br/>rather an exception in point of intellect although 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>in bodily appearance he is a little bushman 
<br/>of the Matebeleour chief was here a few weeks ago for the 
<br/>purpose of being baptized &amp; admitted into the church, a feeble 
<br/>decrepit old man tottering into the grave. After he had 
<br/>carelessly heard the offers of mercy for about 25 years 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>we trust he has now turned to the Lord. His 
<br/>baptism has caused great excitement through the whole 
<br/>country particularly amongst the violent opponents of the 
<br/>gospel. I hope it will lead others to think of themselves 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>&amp; look for mercy before it is too late. the Bechuanas are 
<br/>great beggars, indeed they seem to make it a matter of conscience 
<br/>to neglect no opportunity of asking &amp; a refusal does not by 
<br/>any means put them out if it is done in a jocular way
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>It is only occasionally they think it worth while to tell you 
<br/>what their opinion of you is &amp; really it is ludicrous enough 
<br/>to hear their epithets, instead of getting vexed by them they 
<br/>always powerfully excite my risible faculties. Only think of an 
<br/>old grey headed <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">fat</span></span> man or woman coming forward &amp; saluting 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>me with the epithet "Father, king, Gentleman &amp;c &amp;c and then 
<br/>after a little conversation requesting as a great favour a knife 
<br/>handkerchief or only a little bit of my shirt to bind their heads &amp; 
<br/>when I give them the hint that though I much wish to gratify 
<br/>my children it is quite out of my power. My father or mother 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>adopts quite a different style &amp; tells me "Verily thou art a dog 
<br/>tiger" &amp;c "and whoever marries you will marry a wolf"
<br/>these paternal addresses have one good effect they usually bring 
<br/>something to my mind which sets them off in good humour
<br/>When <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Moteeke</span></span> was with us during the whole fortnight he never 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>begged any &amp; for this he formerly was notorious, the sisterhood 
<br/>will be amused to know I was physician to his majesty but 
<br/>I nearly got into disgrace by shouting out to him as he lay 
<br/>asleep in the middle of the path at midday with his karross 
<br/>over his head Hallo my lad this is not night. He awak
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>ed with a start when I beheld who it was I stooped 
<br/>down &amp; examining his eyes <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">told</span> him I should give him 
<br/>some ointment for them in the afternoon. He seemed 
<br/>quite well pleased &amp; thanked me for my care of him</p>
<br/><p class="p ">When talking to him of his past life he always 
commen-<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>ced crying like a child. this is remarkable for a 
<br/>Bechuana &amp; particularly for a king, they never weep 
<br/><sic xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: until"/><span class="sic diplomatic">untill</span> the Spirit works upon their hearts &amp; then they 
<br/>weep like children. Sometimes in the chapel they 
<br/>hide their heads in their karosses &amp; creep under the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>forms to avoid the eyes of the preacher. this however 
<br/>wont do they then scream out &amp; occasionally rush 
<br/>out of chapel fleeing with all their might. It has often 
<br/>made me wonder for in performing most 
<br/>severe surgical operations they sit both men &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>women as if they had no feeling - In one case of 
<br/>fungous 4 inches in length &amp; nearly 2 in breadth <span class="add  above">nearly 1/2 in height</span> I employed a 
<br/>severe but quick mode of getting rid of it. During the operation 
<br/>I expected him to get up &amp; dance from the pain But no. He 
<br/>sat <sic xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: immovable"/><span class="sic diplomatic">immoveable</span> &amp; talked with as composed a countenance as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>if he felt nothing, "A man like me never cries" said he 
<br/>with the greatest composure. "Its only children who cry"

<br/>The spirit of God alone can affect their health. Without this aid all our efforts 
<br/>must be ineffectual</p>
<br/><p class="p ">There are many believers scattered up &amp; down the country even far from 
<br/>this &amp; where all is opposition (apparantly) the missionaries are pleased to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>know that there is piety even in the centre of the opposition. Pious 
<br/>women particularly are often found where none <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">were</span> <span class="add  above">are</span> expected 
<br/>and often it is impossible to hold intercourse with them as it 
<br/>would subject them to great annoyance from their heathen 
<br/>husbands. Only a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">shred</span> of this can be said where much 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>is needed. We hope however the Lord will uphold his 
<br/>own work in their hearts &amp; enable them to 
<br/>persevere unto the end. the women have hard work 
<br/>to perform amongst the Bechuanas - they cultivate the ground 
<br/>and build the houses while <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">the</span></span> "Lords of the Creation" sew karosses 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>milk the cattle &amp; hunt or sleep. they make very neat 
<br/>builders indeed. It would puzzle their men to do half as well 
<br/>and if the latter are spoken to about it they reply "O it is good for 
<br/>them" "it makes them strong" &amp;c.  It is only a very few of 
<br/>the younger people who can be <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">inclined</span> to do a little of women's 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>work &amp; I dare say their own opinion that hard work makes 
<br/>makes their wives look soon old has more influence over them 
<br/>than any of our arguments. When sitting round a fire 
<br/>by our waggon I have sometimes tried to let the women have 
<br/>a share of it by requesting the men to give way, but 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>that was out of the question. "We are the kings" was <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: damage">[      ]</span>
<br/>a sufficient reason for the women being compelled to <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: damage">[      ]</span>
<br/>behind in the cold. How would <span class="">Agnes</span> like this system of things</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The old spectacles <span class="add  above"><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">ks?</span></span> mother put with my bag were a most acceptable 
<br/>present to an old woman who made great efforts to learn to

<br/>thing to adhere <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">by</span> <span class="add  above">on</span> their own natural way she must hold them 
<br/>always to with the hand. the beads are invaluable - money being 
<br/>of very little use &amp; rather a losing concern as they will take nothing 
<br/>but silver &amp; they always prefer a few beads or a hankerchief

<br/>great opposition in some places &amp; encouragement in others
<br/>He is quite well in health and so I am thankful to say we 
<br/>all are. <span class="">Fergus</span> &amp; <span class="">David</span> still within reach of

<br/><p class="p noindent">I can write no more to <span class="">Charles</span> He is a shabby fellow for a 
<br/>correspondent. Tell him I say so. I think frequently of you 
<br/>all but this language engages mixing thoughts. I am never 
<br/>pleased with the progress I make, the natives do jumble 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>their words so together &amp; then they are so stupid at 
underst-<br/>anding if there is any blunder in my sentences. But I hope 
<br/>soon to overcome. I shall after returning live entirely 
<br/>amongst them &amp; speak not a word of English, I must 
<br/>conquer. Yesterday a man came to carry medicine for his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>wife whom I had just been to see. I gave him instructions 
<br/>to let her have it immediately. Before I could say stop the 
<br/>fellow had it whisked into his own stomach. Although not 
<br/>very agreeable (castor oil) <span class="add  above"> a large quantity</span> he yielded prompt obedience to what he 
<br/>thought I wished, &amp; the reason was I did not use the phrase most 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>commonly employed. the people here are much like what the 
<br/>patriarchs must have been. they are all nomadic if they 
<br/>can possibly find a few cattle. Some are mighty hunters, not 
<br/>your red coated gentry after a fox - I know men here who 
<br/>have attacked lions &amp; killed them with no other weapons than 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>an asagai in one hand &amp; the Kaross wound round the other 
<br/>arm to thrust into his mouth - the mill is more original 
<br/>still than that of the two women which I have seen in use 
<br/>in the colony, a flat stone (broad) with a little roundish one to rub 
<br/>
<br/>with a sort of shoving motion as women in Scotland do with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>their clothes at the bottom of the tub. I can understand 
<br/>why <span class="">Rachel</span> felt so much at being barren, nothing is so 
<br/>great a curse to a B. wife as want of children, they are really 
<br/>miserable if without &amp; children are so valuable.</p><br/>
