<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">London</span> 17 June 1840 </p>
<br/><p class="p ">My Dear Friend </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In compliance with your request 
<br/>I shall not now endeavour to give utterance to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>emotions which spring up in my bosom when 
<br/>I yesterday received your letter. I do this 
<br/>rather reluctantly because, in returning thanks 
<br/>to Him who bestows every good &amp; perfect gift, 
<br/>I would fain include the instrument through 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>whom the blessing has come - </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I was not aware that I had made 
<br/>known my pecuniary difficulties to any one 
<br/>besides him who knows all things, but as 
<br/>I now address a brother disciple of Jesus &amp; a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>friend who (quite unexpected by me) has taken <span class="add  above">an interest</span> in 
<br/>my future course, I may mention that these 
<br/>difficulties were chiefly prospective &amp; that 
<br/>the Lord has now dispelled all my fears 
<br/>&amp; lifted off completely all those cares which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I had, with great freedom the very night 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>proceeding the arrival of your letter, spread out 
<br/>before his throne of grace</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Allow me also to mention that <span class="add  above">it may be said</span> through 
<br/>you Our Gracious Father has assisted one 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>who, with far greater love &amp; zeal &amp; I might say 
<br/>also, abilities than mine, has left this for 
<br/>another country for the purpose of prosecuting 
<br/>those studies which help to qualify for 
<br/>engaging in that most honorable work in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>which I hope to spend my life. His departure 
<br/>having been the chief cause of <span class="del cancelled">my</span> the low 
<br/>state of my resources - </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I feel very grateful for the <span class="underline ">manner</span> in which 
<br/>you have shewn your kindness &amp; would beg an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>interest in your prayers that I may not, after 
<br/>all that the Lord has done for me, become 
<br/>an unprofitable servant. I shall never cease 
<br/>to pray that every temporal &amp; spiritual blessing 
<br/>may descend upon you &amp; that the Lord will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>fulfil the utmost desire of your heart with 
<br/>respect to every one of your beloved family</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Yours very affectionately <span class="sup underline ">D.</span> Livingston </p>
