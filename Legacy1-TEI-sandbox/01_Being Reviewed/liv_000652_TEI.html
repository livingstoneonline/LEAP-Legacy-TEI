<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Oswell">Oswel</span></span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                      </span>Your favour of <span class="">July</span> last containing a communication 
<br/>from our friend <span class="">Vardon</span> reached its destination a short time ago - It was 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>extremely welcome and afforded us much pleasure - I only wish mine 
<br/>may yield a tithe of what yours imparted - It set my mind at ease 
<br/>on several points - I had concluded that my note had miscarried - 
<br/>that you had gone to <span class="">England</span> - &amp; was on the eve of writing to 
<br/><span class="">Vardon</span> for your address - <span class="space">      </span> In addition to the pleasure of perusal 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the prospect of another visit allows us to indulge the pleasures 
<br/>of hope - and our position in this out of the world region has taught 
<br/>us to make the most of this source of employment - On one point 
<br/>I feel a little sorry - and though engaged in building a new house 
<br/>I hasten to remove the impression from your mind which my 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>letter seems unfortunately to have produced - I suspect the wording 
<br/>of my epistle has been as far wrong to induce you to conclude I doubted 
<br/>your accuracy in the Northing of the <span class="">Limpopo</span> - I do not recollect 
<br/>my words but I remember having a conversation with you on the 
<br/>point before my mind in penning it, in which you remarked 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>if the River really did come round as far South as <span class="">Delagoa Bay</span>
<br/>it would be one of the most remarkable rivers in the world - Having 
<br/>ascertained that it really does come very far South I felt anxious to 
<br/>set you right in your idea of the improbability of such a roundabout 
<br/>course - If I appeared to throw discredit on the Northing it makes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>I must have alluded (in my own mind) to <span class="">Arkwright</span><span class="add  above">'s</span> map &amp; I 
<br/>am very sorry the blunder has caused you uneasiness. <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> A</span> left 
<br/>me a sketch but I relied on yours and indeed that information furnished 
<br/>by you and <span class="">Capt<span class="sup ">n</span> M</span> is the only knowledge I posses on that part of the 
<br/>course of the River. I never was East of the Bakaa in the same latitude</p> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><p class="p ">My knowledge of the <span class="">Limpopo</span> was gained in the latitude of <span class="">Chonuane</span>
<br/>and Southwards (a little) I believe <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Murray</span>'s rights to have been 
<br/>pretty correct and from  your account that the <span class="">Limpopo</span> goes 
<br/>as far North as that tribe I see no reason to dissent - But whatever 
<br/>may be the Northing it makes It comes round again to very nearly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the latitude of its source <span class="space">      </span> The source may be a degree South of
<br/><span class="">Chonuane</span> and when it takes in the <span class="">Lepimole</span> it is very near if not
<br/>quite at the latitude of <span class="">Chonuane</span>. The latter however (the junction) 
<br/>I did not see. It was pointed out to me in the distance - In going from 
<br/>this to the Bamapela our course is not quite straight - We have to make 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>some Southing to avoid some ranges of hills - We crossed to <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium"><span class="">Marikoe</span></span> then 
<br/>its source - <span class="">our course was then North East for 9 days</span> and there lies 
<br/>the <span class="">Limpopo</span> again after having traversed the course you know 
<br/>the first two crossings are by windings the main direction of 
<br/>the whole must however be at those parts North West - I imagine 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>its course may be some what of the following shape <span class="figure  " title="outline of river route">{figure}</span>
<br/>there exists a range of very high hills North East 
<br/>of the Bamapela these may be the obstacle to its 
<br/>finding its way to the sea farther north but this 
<br/>is merely conjecture - Do not I entreat you imagine that</p> 
	<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span><p class="ab vertical">What has become of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Murray</span>? I wrote him long ago but suppose my letter has miscarried - I shall let fly at
	<br/>him again soon - I write <span class="">Vardon</span> by this post - and will give you some farther information in the course of the winter</p><br/>

<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent">I doubted the candour with which you made your observations. I supposed 
<br/>that your observations had been vitiated by a mass of magnetic rocks 
<br/>Eastward of <span class="">Chonuane</span> - <span class="">Arkwright</span>s certainly were by some means 
<br/>or other but now I believe it is quite possible yours in respect to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Northing may be correct by supposing that the river makes a great 
<br/>bend. It certainly comes round very far south whatever it may 
<br/>have done in the North - </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have written <span class="">Captain Steele</span> very fully about my projected journey Lakewards
<br/>Our removal to <span class="">Kolobeng</span> has deferred it - but I had proposed to go 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>next month and had your letter not come to hand - I should in a probability 
<br/>have proceeded - I wait now for you if I hear of no one else having 
<br/>his face in that direction. <span class="">Sechele</span> whom you know as a mixture 
<br/>of good &amp; evil has for a considerable time past exhibited most of the 
<br/>former quality on his character - He would accompany me himself 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and as he has a considerable amount of regard for you it is probable 
<br/>he will do the same when you come. I heard him lately saying that 
<br/>you &amp; <span class="">Vardon</span> exceeded all other travellers and when I told him that you 
<br/>intended another visit he seemed much pleased &amp; requested me to 
<br/>return your salutations as that as possible on paper. His conduct 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to us &amp; to others has been for a long time better than we hoped for in 
<br/>a <span class="">native</span> - is a great reader according to his means - has perused 
<br/>the Testament &amp; all the other parts of the Bible printed three times 
<br/>and is <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">found</span> of general information - the innate <span class="">African</span> greed-
<br/>iness may not yet be diminished to others but it is to us for he 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>invariably offers to pay for what he gets from us - We are infinitely 
<br/>better here than where we were formerly, the buildings have been 
<br/>a sore drain on the salary - but we are devoutly thankful that we are 
<br/>away from <span class="">Mabotsa</span>. We have had &amp; still have much hard work 
<br/>but feel in good spirits - We can irrigate now - Have good water - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>A great blessing in <span class="">Africa</span>. People talk of nightingales &amp; poets turn 
<br/>up their eyes to <span class="">Philmel</span> I think they call her because they have 
<br/>nothing else to do But of all the songsters in the world I like best to
<br/>hear the merry frogs Tantalus like up to their chins in water - <span class="">Esop</span> 
<br/>must have been an <span class="">African</span> for he speaks tenderly of these same 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>musicians - We are about <span class="">40 miles</span> West N. West of <span class="">Chonuane</span> - 
<br/>the spot I mentioned as due west of our old place did not afford a 
<br/>good prospect for <span class="">native</span> produce so we went down the stream a 
<br/>little - If no mishap occurs we shall be able to supply you with corn
<br/>next year - So you must not purchase much in the <span class="">Colony</span> - If we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>have it &amp; we shall write &amp; let you know - you must allow us to 
<br/>furnish you with at least corn &amp; potatoes. When we came hither 
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> of his own accord built the school &amp; his people made the 
<br/>watercourse &amp; dam in exchange for some assistance in erecting 
<br/>a square house for their chief - these works saved some expenses 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>which had we been in <span class="">Mabotsa</span> must have been incurred - Poor 
<br/><span class="">Mabotsa</span> <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> quarrelled with <span class="">Mosielele</span> soon after we left - the difference 
<br/>was never made up &amp; scarcely a single Mokhatla either adult or 
<br/>child ever comes near him for instruction - We feel very sorry for 
<br/>this for we worked hard there &amp; matters were looking favourable</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span><p class="p noindent">If you wished to come through <span class="">Mabotsa</span> again - you know the route
<br/>We go by a path West of that station - Leaving the old path at <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Maritsane</span></span>
<br/>we enter the hills near <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Motsenekatze</span></span> &amp; come along by the high hills 
<br/>directly west of the reedy part of <span class="">Motoane</span> where <span class="">Baba</span> was killed 
<br/>on your spoor - We come close  by a large table hill which is visible 

<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>from <span class="">Chonuane</span> - containing plenty of Black buck. We sent out a
<br/>waggon lately by the Western path which the <span class="">Griquas</span> always take 
<br/>on account of the game - Either of these I should prefer if a sportsman 
<br/><span class="">Cumming</span> took your spoor last year with 15 horses 18 dogs &amp; a <span class="">Hottentot 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Venus</span> - a species of solace I suppose. He spent some considerable time 
<br/>in hunting a new buck which he resolved to call A. Ronalyni in honour 
<br/>of himself. I thought it entirely new too - untill I described it to two <span class="">boers</span> 
<br/>I heard them declare it was the Bushbuck of the <span class="">Colony</span>! I have no 
<br/>doubt it is the same you shot &amp; lost among the reed - viz the same 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>as you mention. <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">fine</span> white stripes like the Khoodoo &amp; about 20 
<br/>small <span class="add  above">white</span> spots on the hip - horns of male like those of the goat here - &amp; 
<br/>a darkish belly - hoops prettily curved <span class="add  above">upwards</span> thus - <span class="figure  " title="small drawing of hoof">{figure}</span> - I felt sorry you had not 
<br/>secured it but do not regret now - If no one <span class="add  above">un</span>deceives <span class="">Cumming</span>
<br/>before he gets to the <span class="">Colony</span> - I shall send you a portion of newspaper 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>with the puff he is sure to put in. He passed the <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">Basilaka</span> I could 
<br/>not ascertain from him how far but believe it must have 
<br/>been 7 or 9 days beyond at most. He gave the <span class="">Limpopo</span> a little more 
<br/>bend South than you - a very little however - says he killed 33 elephants 
<br/>a great number of hippopotomi - Went to some hills West of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>River to hunt putokuane  - was successful - and so were the Tsetse 
<br/>for he wrote to us from beyond the junction of the <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Hotoaue</span></span> for 
<br/>the loan of oxen - One solitary mare &amp; two oxen with a dog or two 
<br/>attested what the fly can do. One of his <span class="">Hottentots</span> was snatched away 
<br/>from the fire one evening by a lion &amp; devoured a few paces from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the waggon - <span class="">Cumming</span> killed it next day - He will never think of
<br/>the Lake - Not he - unless somebody tells him that he may get ivory 
<br/>lying on the ground there - He is by far the keenest trader we have 
<br/>seen in <span class="">Africa</span> - When he sees an elephant he does not become excited 
<br/>with the idea of sport - He says in his heart "there goes £25" I could not 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>help pitying him when he made the confession - feels anxious to obtain 
<br/>a farm - Is uncertain too whether he will come up again. I think his 
<br/>necessaries will drive him in again but it will be  to the <span class="">Limpopo</span>
<br/><span class="del cancelled">again</span> - I mention this much concerning him that you feel at ease 
<br/>on his future course - </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><p class="p ">I feel confident that <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ashton</span> has <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the sum you mention. If 
<br/>he had not I should have heard it from him when at <span class="">Kuruman</span> - I distinctly 
<br/>remember that he stated the manner in which you settled about the rifle 
<br/>he thought a money transaction would be the most <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 8 chars, cause: illegible">[        ]</span> it if you
<br/>&amp; therefore said he I proposed it to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> O.</span> I shall ask him however - <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>Hume</span> has been in <span class="">Graham's town</span> for some time past. I shall 
<br/>deliver your message by first opportunity &amp; it will probably reach 
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> as soon as he - your kind gift to me was brought 
<br/>to us in <span class="">August</span> last, the rogues however had taken as much 
<br/>benefit out of it during the two years they kept it from me as to render 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>him useless for some time after I got him - the sickness began 
<br/>early this season and he fell a victim to my great sorrow - We got by 
<br/>him several elands &amp; <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">Kameels</span> - I had always doubts about his identity, he 
<br/>had a bay mane &amp; tail now you mentioned that these points were black 
<br/>they deny the <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">sadle</span> - It may however yet turn out when no longer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>usable. We felt the more sorry to part with the poor animal  as it was 
<br/>in our minds closely associated with yourself - As I am on a four footed 
<br/>subject I may mention that <span class="">Robert</span>'s cow has calved <span class="add  above">a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: heifer">hiefer</span> calf</span> &amp; both cow &amp; 
<br/>calf are now very beautiful animals - We thank you for the milk
<br/>you have given us. <span class="">Robert</span> runs about now &amp; speaks a little in both  
<br/><span class="linenumber">55</span>languages, his sister helps him occasionally in the 

<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>matrimonial music we enjoy - If you heard them both at it you would con
<br/>-clude  that <span class="">Selkirk</span> talked nonsense when he said something about science 
<br/>is shocking to me. I am building a new house at present. I burned the 
<br/>old house &amp; school lest a <span class="">boer</span> might take up his residence in them - This 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>brings to my mind the <span class="">Boer</span> expedition to <span class="">Mosilikatze</span>. It was a mere foray 
<br/>for cattle &amp; they succeeded in carrying of a number but the Matibele recaptured 
<br/>them &amp; killed a great number of their <span class="">native</span> auxiliaries - the expedition 
<br/>ended by their attacking one of their assistant tribes - the Bamapela - and 
<br/>carrying off a great number of children &amp; sheep - I saw in my late journey 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>many Bamapela children in their houses kept in a kind of <span class="">slavery</span>. The 
<br/><span class="">Boers</span> generally are indignant until the party which acted treacherously 
<br/>with a friendly tribe - they have had some meetings on the subject But 
<br/>I need not trouble you with <span class="">Boer</span> politics - The above is the report given 
<br/>by the <span class="">boers</span> themselves &amp; the <span class="">native</span> report agrees with it - The <span class="">Boers</span> generally 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>intend an expedition against <span class="">Moszilikatse</span> in May next, they crossed the 
<br/><span class="">Limpopo</span> somewhere about  x <span class="">Cumming</span> did not see their spoor 
<br/>so I conclude he did not go very much further than yourselves. <span class="">Mosilikatse</span>
<br/>lives not very far from the <span class="">Limpopo</span>. It would be dangerous to go very 
<br/>far down the River on the northern bank - One might fall in with
